## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

My first time using a CSS framework. Tailwindcss is very intuitive and easy to work with. I had fun and i enjoyed the whole process, from setting things up to learning the basic layout structure and class names. It was an easy challenge, quite basic grid layout!

### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Definetely the best resource for guidance and class names reference.
